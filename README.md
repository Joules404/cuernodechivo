Engineering Requirements
Stack
HTML, CSS, JS, MySQL, PHP, some user auth 
HTTP or WebSocket (see below)
Head-to-Head 
How the multiplayer aspect will be handled.
Option 1 - Each user completes a type-test, submits (post), and then can see their stats against each other at the end.
Pros
Easier to implement
HTTP is easier
Cons
Unintuitive for the user
It will look like they are just doing a type test and seeing extra stuff at the end
Poor UI representation 
Would not really feel like a head-to-head 
Option 2 - Users type in the same box, at the same time, and can see their progress against each other. 
Pros
Intuitive for the user
Looks great
Cons
Harder to implement
Nobody wants to do WebSockets
If something messes up (due to bad implementation) it will be obvious
A lot harder to hide at this point
Delay is the big issue
